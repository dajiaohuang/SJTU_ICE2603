CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 449 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is computer_main/cpu/ip/q[31]_i_13. Please evaluate your design.

CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 449 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is computer_main/cpu/ip/q[31]_i_13. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: computer_main/imem/dram_i_2, computer_main/imem/dram_i_40, computer_main/imem/dram_i_43, computer_main/imem/dram_i_44, computer_main/imem/dram_i_49, computer_main/imem/dram_i_50, computer_main/imem/dram_i_51, computer_main/imem/dram_i_53, computer_main/imem/dram_i_55, computer_main/imem/dram_i_56, computer_main/imem/dram_i_57, computer_main/cpu/regfile/dram_i_128, computer_main/cpu/regfile/dram_i_129, computer_main/imem/dram_i_130, computer_main/imem/dram_i_131... and (the first 15 of 449 listed).

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0
